## Petivity

This project is the realization of a quarter long project for CS 147, Introduction to Human-Computer Interation, a class I took at Stanford. 

Throughout the quarter, my team, Crystal Zhen, Jonathan Mao, and Sidra Ijaz, and I learned about the iterative process of user design. This chrome extension/iPhone application hybrid is the result of multiple needfinding and prototyping cycles.

The final assignment of the class was to build a Hi-Fi prototype which can be presented to a user for user testing. As such, much of the present functionality uses "Wizard of Oz" prototyping methodologies.
